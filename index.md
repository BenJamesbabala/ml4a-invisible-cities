A project made during "Machine Learning for Artists workshop" with [Gene Kogan](https://github.com/genekogan) @[Opendotlab](http://www.opendotlab.it)

## Concept
“With cities, it is as with dreams: everything imaginable can be dreamed, but even the most unexpected dream is a rebus that conceals a desire or, its reverse, a fear. Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.”
_― [Italo Calvino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_Calvino), Invisible Cities_

The idea is to create an imaginary city from a hand-drawn sketch. Trained with aerial images of real cities, a neural network can transform this into a realistic bird-eye-view city.
Then, switching between different cities references it would be possible to generate different views of the same imaginary city.
